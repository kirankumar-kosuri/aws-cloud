# LOAD BALANCER
* Load Balancer is nothing but its distibute's the load for applications etc...
# Example
* I deployed a application in my EC2 instance for game development so 5 people are using that application but one day my game gets populated at that time 1000 members access my application goes down at that time user will face problems like slow access or down time at that time if we place load balance in front of our instance the user can access load balancer instead of accessing ec2 instance
