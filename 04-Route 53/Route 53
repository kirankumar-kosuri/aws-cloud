# Route53
=========
* DNS[Domain Name System]
* In AWS Route53 provides DNS as a Service 
* Humans remember names, Computer works on numbers means for a human we cannot remember Ip address we can remember domain names instead of it
* For Example 172.17.0.1 it is hard to remember instead of it we can convert Ip address to Domain Name through DNS like Google.com  we can access applications with domain names 
* DNS Resolver -> A simple software running in ISP servers to fetch the IP address for a domain 

What happens when we buy a domain?
==================================
* If we take domain name like daws86s.online we can pay to godaddy/hostinger to purchase the domain
* .online -> Who owns it domain.Registars == godaddy/hostinger TLD pays commission to godaddy
* If we want to keep the Domain permenent we can purchase in GoDaddy.If we want temparary we can purchase in Hostinger
* Nameservers update to TLD, Here TLD is nothing but Top Level Domain

Type of records
===============
A -> IpV4 address
CNAME --> Another domain
MX -> Mail servers
TXT -> Domain verrification purpose
AAAA -> IpV6
NS -> Nameservers, who is controlling the domain
SOA -> Who is controlling

* mysql.daws86s.fun -> MySQL private IP
* TTL -> Time to live (Controls how much your cache keeps this record, before issuing next request)
* High TTL -> DNS overload decreases. stable websites will have high TTL
* Low TTL -> migration activities. decrease TTL
