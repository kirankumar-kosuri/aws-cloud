# ECR VS DockerHub
* DockerHub is free initially we can login and we can create an account with dockerhub and we can create public repository  in dockerhub

# What is Public Repository
* When we push our docker image's into public repository everyone in the world can see and download our image's
* We can create privite repository in dockerhub but only authorized people can see image's and download who have access to the repository they can view everything

# ECR

* ECR mainly focus on security 

# Key Benefits of ECR
